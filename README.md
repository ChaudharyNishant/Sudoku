# Sudoku
The classic Sudoku puzzle. This is the 6x6 version.

The puzzle is divided into 6 rectangles (2x3) consisting of 6 fields (3x2). Total 36 fields. Some of the fields are already filled. Fill the remaining fields. Each row, column and rectangle can contain numbers 1 to 6 exactly once. The puzzle can have multiple solution.

You can not change the pre-filled numbers. To fill in new numbers, click on an empty box and type in the number. You can edit a number too which you earlier filled but now wants to change. There is a Submit button to check if the puzzle is incomplete, incorrect or correct. There is a timer which records the time taken to solve the puzzle. Once you think that you have solved the puzzle, click on Submit and the timer will stop.
There is score too which calculates the score based on the time taken.

You can play a new game or quit at any time.
